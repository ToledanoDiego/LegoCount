##### Description : #####

  This paragraph is the description of the method I have used. My code is simply the use of three
  parts. The first one is a part that determine the scale at which the Lego bricks are displayed by
  comparing features of the pictures to the corresponding real Lego bricks. The second part is a
  picture manipulation that take out all the blue and red bricks of the picture. The last part then
  remove the bigger and the smaller bricks than the size of the wanted one.
